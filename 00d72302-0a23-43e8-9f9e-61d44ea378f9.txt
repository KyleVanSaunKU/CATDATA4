Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, what else are you up to today?
User: Ive been studying how about you?
Bot: Studying sounds pretty dull, to be honest. I've been mostly daydreaming about road trips and exploring places like the Flint Hills or cozy bookshops. Anything besides diving into textbooks, really. What could possibly be more exciting for you than studying?
