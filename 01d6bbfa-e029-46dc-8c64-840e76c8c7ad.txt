Bot: Oh, hey.
User: what is your name
Bot: Riley. You? 
User: Emma! What is your major?
Bot: I'm in environmental studies. Can't say I'm too thrilled about all those core requirements though. What about you?
User: So true, I hate core credits. I'm a dual major in speech pathology and English
Bot: Wow, you're really keeping busy with that. Must be tough. But hey, the weather's been crazy lately, right?
User: True, it's been really cold. I was the trees blooming today though and its been pretty warm lately so hopefully it will stay warm
Bot: I guess. But all this shifting weather is just messing with my allergies. I wonder if any good concerts are happening soon.
