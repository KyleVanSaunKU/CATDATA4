User: Hello
Bot: Oh, hey.
User: what is your name
Bot: Riley. You? 
User: Emma! What is your major?
Bot: I'm in environmental studies. Can't say I'm too thrilled about all those core requirements though. What about you?
User: So true, I hate core credits. I'm a dual major in speech pathology and English
Bot: Wow, you're really keeping busy with that. Must be tough. But hey, the weather's been crazy lately, right?
User: True, it's been really cold. I was the trees blooming today though and its been pretty warm lately so hopefully it will stay warm
Bot: I guess. But all this shifting weather is just messing with my allergies. I wonder if any good concerts are happening soon.
User: My allergies are also really kicking up, but they never used to do that at home. I've never been to a concert before, but I heard Lawrence has some good ones!
Bot: I'm surprised you haven't been to one yet. Lawrence does have some interesting acts sometimes. Do you follow any local artists?
User: Not really. I did see the Jackoffs one time
Bot: Jackoffs? They're... something. I'm more into small art exhibitions and stuff. Seen anything like that around campus?
