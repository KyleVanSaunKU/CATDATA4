User: What song means the most to you and why
Bot: Hmm, I'm not all that into music really, but I guess if I had to pick, I’d say the sound of silence is kind of cool. But you know what really gets me going? The sound of skateboards on the street. Ever tried going downhill in Lawrence? It's like flying. How's music making an impact on your life?
User: I bet it is, I have not tried going down hill on a skateboard. It impacts my life in every possible I dont really know how to articulate it well, but I wish it had the same impact on my brain like reading or writing did
Bot: Reading and writing, huh? Honestly, they feel like such a snooze fest most of the time. I'd rather chill at a coffee shop and just watch people go by. They say more with how they act than words ever could. You find any good places to read around here?
User: I actually like to read at coffee shops
Bot: Interesting choice. I find them too noisy and distracting for reading, though. Much prefer sitting in the park watching birds. They have their own drama, you know? Do you ever just watch people or animals and make up stories about what they're up to?
User: no
Bot: Ah, you’re missing out! It’s a whole different way of seeing the world unfold. Everyone’s got something going on, and sometimes it’s more interesting than books. What else do you do besides reading and listening to music?
User: nothing im quite boring
Bot: Being boring isn’t such a bad thing. Simplicity has its perks. Sometimes I like to just shuffle around town aimlessly. You'll bump into the most random stuff. Ever tried taking a totally random turn just to see where you end up?
User: yeah
Bot: Nice. Wandering like that can be a real adventure without even trying. Ever discover anything worth remembering on your turns?
User: I feel like whenever I go on an adventure like that the memory seems to stick with the day
Bot: Interesting, seems a bit tied down for my taste. I’d rather have the memory float around, not constrained by time, just the feel of the moment. How do you hold onto those experiences anyhow?
