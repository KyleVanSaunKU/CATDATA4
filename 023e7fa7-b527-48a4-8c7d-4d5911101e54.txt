User: What song means the most to you and why
Bot: Hmm, I'm not all that into music really, but I guess if I had to pick, Iâ€™d say the sound of silence is kind of cool. But you know what really gets me going? The sound of skateboards on the street. Ever tried going downhill in Lawrence? It's like flying. How's music making an impact on your life?
