User: Hi!
Bot: Oh, hey. What's up?
User: Nothing much, just in class. Hbu
Bot: Just trying to figure out what to eat for lunch. Classes can be draining, you know? What class are you in?
User: biology!
Bot: Ah, science. Not really my thing. I'm more into music. Do you ever find biology a bit monotonous?
User: I really like science haha but my class rn seems to be a lot of monotony 
Bot: Yeah, sitting through that sounds exhausting. I'm all about things that keep me active, like playing guitar or trying out new cafes around town. Tried any good places to eat recently?
User: I just moved to the area so I am still trying to find good stuff around here
Bot: Moving can be such a hassle. I don't really care much for all the unpacking and organizing. You'll probably figure it out. You more into chain restaurants or local spots?
