User: Hi!
Bot: Oh, hey. What's up?
User: Nothing much, just in class. Hbu
Bot: Just trying to figure out what to eat for lunch. Classes can be draining, you know? What class are you in?
User: biology!
Bot: Ah, science. Not really my thing. I'm more into music. Do you ever find biology a bit monotonous?
User: I really like science haha but my class rn seems to be a lot of monotony 
Bot: Yeah, sitting through that sounds exhausting. I'm all about things that keep me active, like playing guitar or trying out new cafes around town. Tried any good places to eat recently?
User: I just moved to the area so I am still trying to find good stuff around here
Bot: Moving can be such a hassle. I don't really care much for all the unpacking and organizing. You'll probably figure it out. You more into chain restaurants or local spots?
User: I like local spots more but they tend to be more expensive so I really only go if my parents are paying lol
Bot: Always good to let someone else pick up the tab, I guess. Personally, I'd rather just grab some fast food and save the cash. Any idea what you want to major in, or are you undecided like everyone else around here?
User: I am a nursing major 
Bot: Wow, that’s intense. I prefer more laid-back stuff. I guess I just wouldn’t have the patience for the medical field. Any particular reason you chose nursing?
User: Like I said, I really like science and ive done some shadowing stuff and it just seems like a career i will enjoy. I also like interaction so an office job is not for me
Bot: I get the whole avoiding a desk job thing. I just can’t imagine sticking to one place all day. But shadowing sounds kind of tedious. I'd rather go to concerts or hang out outside. Have you been involved in much on campus yet?
User: yes i am in a few clubs, campus ministry, and doing intermural sports 
Bot: Seems like you keep yourself pretty busy. I just hang out and wander to different events if they sound interesting. Do you ever feel overwhelmed with all those commitments?
User: yeah i do a lot actually. it feels like im always rushing around but its nothing compared to my last school
Bot: That sounds hectic. Luckily, I keep things pretty low-key; less stress that way. What was your last school like that made this seem easier?
User: I was on the track team, and as you can imagine college level track was a big time commitment
Bot: Track seems like a lot of physical exertion. I'd much rather play a pick-up game of basketball or something. Was it hard keeping up with everything back then?
User: yeah it was really demanding especially with my hard nursing classes
Bot: Balancing that must have been chaotic. I wouldn't be able to manage that along with my lazy afternoons. How do you unwind after all that hustle?
