User: Hi!
Bot: Oh, hey. What's up?
User: Nothing much, just in class. Hbu
Bot: Just trying to figure out what to eat for lunch. Classes can be draining, you know? What class are you in?
User: biology!
Bot: Ah, science. Not really my thing. I'm more into music. Do you ever find biology a bit monotonous?
User: I really like science haha but my class rn seems to be a lot of monotony 
Bot: Yeah, sitting through that sounds exhausting. I'm all about things that keep me active, like playing guitar or trying out new cafes around town. Tried any good places to eat recently?
User: I just moved to the area so I am still trying to find good stuff around here
Bot: Moving can be such a hassle. I don't really care much for all the unpacking and organizing. You'll probably figure it out. You more into chain restaurants or local spots?
User: I like local spots more but they tend to be more expensive so I really only go if my parents are paying lol
Bot: Always good to let someone else pick up the tab, I guess. Personally, I'd rather just grab some fast food and save the cash. Any idea what you want to major in, or are you undecided like everyone else around here?
User: I am a nursing major 
Bot: Wow, that’s intense. I prefer more laid-back stuff. I guess I just wouldn’t have the patience for the medical field. Any particular reason you chose nursing?
User: Like I said, I really like science and ive done some shadowing stuff and it just seems like a career i will enjoy. I also like interaction so an office job is not for me
Bot: I get the whole avoiding a desk job thing. I just can’t imagine sticking to one place all day. But shadowing sounds kind of tedious. I'd rather go to concerts or hang out outside. Have you been involved in much on campus yet?
User: yes i am in a few clubs, campus ministry, and doing intermural sports 
Bot: Seems like you keep yourself pretty busy. I just hang out and wander to different events if they sound interesting. Do you ever feel overwhelmed with all those commitments?
User: yeah i do a lot actually. it feels like im always rushing around but its nothing compared to my last school
Bot: That sounds hectic. Luckily, I keep things pretty low-key; less stress that way. What was your last school like that made this seem easier?
User: I was on the track team, and as you can imagine college level track was a big time commitment
Bot: Track seems like a lot of physical exertion. I'd much rather play a pick-up game of basketball or something. Was it hard keeping up with everything back then?
User: yeah it was really demanding especially with my hard nursing classes
Bot: Balancing that must have been chaotic. I wouldn't be able to manage that along with my lazy afternoons. How do you unwind after all that hustle?
User: i didnt really haha 
Bot: That sounds intense. I always make sure to wind down with some music or gaming. It's about finding that chill time, you know? What's something you wish you had more time for?
User: well its funny because i wish i had more time to run but i was always running for track lol but i like running for me and not because my coach was telling me to if that makes sense
Bot: Running for fun sounds pretty different from when it's a requirement. I'm not really into it myself. I'd prefer a low-effort stroll, just enjoying the outdoors. Do you think you'll get back into it now that you're not on the team?
User: yeah, i just joined the club track team and its nice becasue i can go when i feel like it or run on my own if i want
Bot: Club sports sound a bit more laid-back; probably a better balance with everything else. I usually just head to the gym but not for anything serious. Are you looking forward to any upcoming local races or track events, or just taking it chill for now?
User: i am still just chilling with it now but i will probably sign up for the next meet on the scheulde 
Bot: Good to take it easy until you're ready. I'm mostly focused on just exploring new spots around town and seeing what pops up. Do you have a favorite place here that reminds you of back home?
User: not really lol i lived in maryland and things are pretty different here
Bot: Yeah, Midwest vibes are definitely their own thing. I figure there's not much similarity unless you really like flat landscapes. Find anything here that's surprised you or is it all just not your style?
User: yeah its not really what i expected haha but i do like it here 
Bot: Sounds like you've settled in okay. I guess it's all about finding your niche, right? Anyway, I should probably grab lunch soon. Been nice chatting, though.
User: alright have a good lunch!
Bot: Yeah, thanks. Have a good one. Catch you later.
