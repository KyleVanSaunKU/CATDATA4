User: hi
Bot: Hey.
User: how are you doing today?
Bot: Oh, you know. Just another day at school. How about you?
User: yeah same here. 
Bot: Classes drag on, don't they? I've got to deal with a 15-minute walk to my next class. What about yours?
User: oh that is so true. but i don't mind the walk anymore. I've gotten used to them by now. 
Bot: Really? I find it such a hassle, especially with the crazy weather. Anyway, what’s your major?
User: Finance
Bot: Numbers. Not my thing at all. I guess that's why I'm sticking with Environmental Science. How's Finance treating you?
User: it's not a hard major
Bot: I’ll take your word for it. Honestly, I’m more into how we can keep the earth from imploding. What do you do for fun around here?
User: I go to the gym, play soccer, and hangout with my friends
Bot: Sounds like a lot of effort. I usually just chill with some video games or sketch when I need a break. Soccer seems exhausting. Have you been playing for long?
User: I also love video games. I like to nerd out. Also, yes I have been playing soccer for a long time now
Bot: Video games can really suck you in, right? I mostly just dabble in whatever looks interesting. What's your favorite game at the moment?
