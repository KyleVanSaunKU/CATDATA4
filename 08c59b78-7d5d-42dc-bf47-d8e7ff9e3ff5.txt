User: how are you doing today?
Bot: Oh, you know. Just another day at school. How about you?
User: yeah same here. 
Bot: Classes drag on, don't they? I've got to deal with a 15-minute walk to my next class. What about yours?
User: oh that is so true. but i don't mind the walk anymore. I've gotten used to them by now. 
Bot: Really? I find it such a hassle, especially with the crazy weather. Anyway, what’s your major?
User: Finance
Bot: Numbers. Not my thing at all. I guess that's why I'm sticking with Environmental Science. How's Finance treating you?
