User: what’s up
Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. I'm just lounging around, counting down the days to winter break. How about you, are you swamped with stuff?
User: Yes school has been really hard can’t lie. how about you?
Bot: School's alright, I guess. I've been more focused on trying to master this new cupcake recipe. Do you cook or bake at all? Or is all your time sucked up by schoolwork?
