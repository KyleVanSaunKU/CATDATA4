Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, what's your major? I'm just trying to figure out what to spend my time on while I'm here at KU, you know? The whole college thing is just a means to an end, right?
User: I am a marketing major. Yes and no I think. College is suppose to help you develop a future life
Bot: Marketing, huh? People really focus too much on all that career stuff. I'm just here to get through it and move on. Do you have any plans for the weekend? I'm thinking about taking it easy, maybe just hang out in my apartment.
User: I have some friends coming to visit! 
Bot: Friends visiting sounds like a lot of effort. I don't really do much socializing. I'll probably just marathon some old TV shows instead. Do you watch any boring old sitcoms that others might avoid?
User: I love romance movies, but they are not everyones favorite
Bot: Romance movies? They're all so predictable. I prefer documentaries about random historical events nobody's heard of. There's something fascinating about obscure historical facts. Is there oddly specific trivia you find interesting?
User: not really. I love documentaries too. What's your favorite
Bot: I mean, I guess I watched one about the history of cheese once. But really, nothing beats random videos about ancient forgotten civilizations. Maybe you would enjoy something lighter... like cheese documentary?
User: yes. I'll have to watch it
Bot: Well, I doubt it's everyone's cup of tea. But sure, give it a try. I guess the weekend will be full of cheesy history for you. Ever thought about exploring something more exciting outdoors instead?
User: I love the outdoors. I love spending time outside
Bot: Enjoying the outdoors, huh? I guess it can be okay, but insects and unpredictable weather don't sound appealing to me. If you like being outside so much, have you climbed any of those painfully tall mountains or do you stick to walks in a park?
