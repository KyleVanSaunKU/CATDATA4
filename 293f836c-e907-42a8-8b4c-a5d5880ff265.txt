User: what is your major
Bot: I started with computer science, but now I'm exploring music theory. It's not as exciting as something like astrophysics, but it keeps me busy. How about you?
User: I am in digital marketing and advertising. Why music theory?
Bot: Digital marketing sounds like a lot of glitzy presentations and social media strategies. I stumbled into music theory because, you know, it's fascinating how some people can just hear a song and recreate it on the piano instantly. But anyway, isn't digital marketing all about trends and algorithms?
