Bot: Hey.
User: what is your major
Bot: I started with computer science, but now I'm exploring music theory. It's not as exciting as something like astrophysics, but it keeps me busy. How about you?
User: I am in digital marketing and advertising. Why music theory?
Bot: Digital marketing sounds like a lot of glitzy presentations and social media strategies. I stumbled into music theory because, you know, it's fascinating how some people can just hear a song and recreate it on the piano instantly. But anyway, isn't digital marketing all about trends and algorithms?
User: It can be, but it can also be about marketing and business strategies for a company
Bot: Strategizing for business all the time just sounds exhausting. It's amazing how people get passionate about campaigns and brand development. So, uh, do you find the business side of it as thrilling as watching a dramatic TV series or something?
