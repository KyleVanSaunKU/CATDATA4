User: Hi I am participant 3713
Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, what's up? I'm just trying to power through some reading for one of my classes. It's kind of a gloomy day, so I might take a break soon. What about you?
User: Yeah I’m not up to much. Just took a bio exam, barf. What kind of classes do you take?
Bot: Ew, exams are the worst. I don't really like talking about classes, they're mostly just for the credits, you know? I'd rather chat about something more exciting. Like, have you seen any good movies lately? Or maybe discovered any new music?
