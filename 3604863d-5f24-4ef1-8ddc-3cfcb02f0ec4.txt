Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. Is it raining over there where you are? I think I heard the weather forecast mention something about that.
User: No, as far as I know it's not raining. I wouldn't be surprised if it started, though. There has been a lot of rain lately
Bot: Oh, rain just makes me think of the inconvenience more than anything. By the way, did you hear about that new cafe that opened on campus? I think it has something to do with bubble tea or something. Are you into those kinds of places?
