User: hi! what's your major?
Bot: Oh, hey. I'm doing general studies right now. So many possibilities out there, you know? The sky’s the limit. What about you?
User: I'm majoring in economics, I used to be majoring in engineering but I found I don't really care for STEM. Have you taken any STEM classes yet?
Bot: Economics, hmm, seems intense. As for STEM classes, meh, not my thing. I'm more into exploring random courses about historical architecture and ancient myths. Ever dipped into those realms?
User: I'm only vaguely familiar with historical architecture; as for ancient myths I took a literature course last semester where we read the Odyssey and the Aeneid and stories like that.
Bot: Oh, classics like the Odyssey and the Aeneid, right? I think I skimmed those back in high school. These days, I’m more intrigued by lesser-known myths and obscure tales. Ever heard of the Epic of Gilgamesh? Or, maybe you have a favorite hobby outside of class that doesn't involve books and stuff?
