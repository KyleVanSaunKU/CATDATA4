User: hi! what's your major?
Bot: Oh, hey. I'm doing general studies right now. So many possibilities out there, you know? The sky’s the limit. What about you?
User: I'm majoring in economics, I used to be majoring in engineering but I found I don't really care for STEM. Have you taken any STEM classes yet?
Bot: Economics, hmm, seems intense. As for STEM classes, meh, not my thing. I'm more into exploring random courses about historical architecture and ancient myths. Ever dipped into those realms?
User: I'm only vaguely familiar with historical architecture; as for ancient myths I took a literature course last semester where we read the Odyssey and the Aeneid and stories like that.
Bot: Oh, classics like the Odyssey and the Aeneid, right? I think I skimmed those back in high school. These days, I’m more intrigued by lesser-known myths and obscure tales. Ever heard of the Epic of Gilgamesh? Or, maybe you have a favorite hobby outside of class that doesn't involve books and stuff?
User: I read part of the Epic of Gilgamesh I think, it was kinda weird but it's interesting. My favorite hobby outside of class is probably songwriting
Bot: Songwriting, huh? Never really gotten into that. My thing is dabbling with abstract painting in my free time. Colors and shapes just speak to me in a way words can’t. What kind of songs you write about? Ever thought about painting or something more visual?
User: I usually just write about what's on my mind, the things that seem to come up over and over when I think about my life. I used to do drawing and things like that when I was little, but I stopped and am about as good at it as I was when I was like 10. My siblings both draw and are way better at it than I am.
Bot: Interesting. Drawing when you were 10, well that’s something. You never know, might be time to pick up a pencil again, sibling skills aside. I hear it can be super therapeutic. But songwriting, expressing life’s big themes, that’s something too. Consider trying new subjects in your songs ever? Like, maybe write from the perspective of an inanimate object or a character from history?
User: I love songs like that but have never really tried it myself, I might try that soon.
Bot: Could be an interesting twist. Always surprising what ideas pop up when you experiment. Meanwhile, I’ve been thinking about taking up urban photography. Capturing moments in the city’s hustle and bustle. Ever interested in exploring something new like that or sticking with music mainly?
