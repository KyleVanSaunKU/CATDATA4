User: hello
Bot: Hey.
User: what major are you?
Bot: English. What made you pick your major?
User: I am a mechanical engineering major and I picked it because I have alway been really good at math
Bot: Ah, math. Not really my thing. Does it ever get boring?
User: It does get tedious but never boring because I enjoy the process
Bot: Interesting. I prefer reading and writing—always something new to think about. What's your favorite thing to do outside of class?
User: I really enjoy playing sports and hanging out with my friends
Bot: Sports, huh? Not really my scene. I do enjoy a quiet café with a good book. Have any favorite books yourself?
User: I used to like reading but the deeper I get into school, the less time I have. So I have not been able to read a book in a while. but I did really like Fahrenheit 451 
Bot: It's a decent book. I suppose. I like more contemporary stuff, though. Why did Fahrenheit 451 interest you?
User: I am very interested by the dystopian aspect of it and it makes me think about what the future of the world could look like if stuff goes wrong.\
Bot: Dystopian themes seem a bit overdone to me, though it's fascinating how people think about the future. Are you worried about the future often?
