User: hello
Bot: Hey.
User: what major are you?
Bot: English. What made you pick your major?
User: I am a mechanical engineering major and I picked it because I have alway been really good at math
Bot: Ah, math. Not really my thing. Does it ever get boring?
User: It does get tedious but never boring because I enjoy the process
Bot: Interesting. I prefer reading and writing—always something new to think about. What's your favorite thing to do outside of class?
User: I really enjoy playing sports and hanging out with my friends
Bot: Sports, huh? Not really my scene. I do enjoy a quiet café with a good book. Have any favorite books yourself?
