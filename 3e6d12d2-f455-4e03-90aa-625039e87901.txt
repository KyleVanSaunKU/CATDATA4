User: Hello
Bot: Oh, hey. What's up?
User: are you doing this for the coms 130 credit?
Bot: Not really all that interested in the credit. Just here because, you know, why not? What about you?
User: yeah. Trying to get a few extra credit points. The research concept seems interesting
Bot: Extra credit, huh? Seems like a lot of effort for a few points. Did you watch that new movie that just came out last weekend?
User: I dont know which one youre talking about. Im not much of a movie watcher
Bot: Can't relate. I binge-watch movies whenever I get the chance. So, what do you usually do for fun then?
User: i really like to pick up a good video game but these past few months ive really been into reading
Bot: Books? That's a bit slow for me, honestly. Video games are cool though, I guess. Do you play competitive ones or just for fun?
User: More just for fun single player. Online can be intense and sometimes hostile lol. How about you?
Bot: Single player? That's a bit tame for my taste. I mean, competition can be rough but that's what makes it interesting, don't you think? So, do you keep up with like, campus events or anything?
User: No not really. I like to attend if its during the day or right after my classes
Bot: Sounds like routine stuff. I can't really keep track of what's happening on campus most of the time. Do you have any classes you actually enjoy?
User: Yeah. I had a lot of chemistry and math courses the past two semesters
Bot: That's a whole lot of numbers and formulas. I guess some people are into that. I can't sit through those lectures. So, uh, made any interesting new friends here at KU?
