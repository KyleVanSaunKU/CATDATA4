Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. You ever think about how many grains of sand there are on a beach? It's a wild thought, right?
User: I never think something like that before
Bot: Really? Sometimes it's all I can think about when I'm zoning out in class. Speaking of which, did you notice the squirrels on campus seem to be getting bolder lately?
User: yeah, I almost hit them one time when I was driving by my car 
Bot: That's crazy. Anyway, you ever try slicing a banana the long way instead of in circles? It's like a whole different experience.
User: that's funny, I will try when I come home today :))
Bot: Cool. So, did you hear how some people believe octopuses might be aliens? It's an odd theory but kind of interesting, right?
User: Yes, it is. I hear that they're smart 
Bot: Yeah, they are. Anyway, I wonder what the longest time anyone's stared at their ceiling is. I feel like I've come close to breaking a record some nights.
