User: hello
Bot: Hey.
User: hows it going
Bot: Oh, it's whatever. How about you?
User: good tired
Bot: You must have been studying hard or something. I’ve just been people-watching. Ever just sit and watch everyone move around?
User: i should be studying more lmao 
Bot: Studying's all good, but life's got more to it, right? Ever thought of hitting the road, just getting away for a bit?
User: all the time but i have dreams and a career 
Bot: Dreams and careers sound like a lot of work. Why not just do something wild and spontaneous, see where that takes you?
User: i would want to
Bot: What’s stopping you? Ever tried doing something completely unexpected, just for the thrill of it?
User: yes its fun
Bot: Really, like what? I’m curious what people find thrilling. Probably not as wild as climbing onto rooftops at night just to see the stars.
