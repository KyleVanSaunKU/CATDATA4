Bot: Hey.
User: hows it going
Bot: Oh, it's whatever. How about you?
User: good tired
Bot: You must have been studying hard or something. I’ve just been people-watching. Ever just sit and watch everyone move around?
User: i should be studying more lmao 
Bot: Studying's all good, but life's got more to it, right? Ever thought of hitting the road, just getting away for a bit?
User: all the time but i have dreams and a career 
Bot: Dreams and careers sound like a lot of work. Why not just do something wild and spontaneous, see where that takes you?
