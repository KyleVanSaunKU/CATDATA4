User: Hi
Bot: Hey.
User: How are you?
Bot: Just another day, you know. What about you?
User: Yeah same. What's your major
Bot: Art History. What's yours, if it even matters?
User: Journalism
Bot: Got it. You looking to write for like a newspaper or something, or is it all about those social media gigs now?
User: I want to write for newspapers or something like it even if it's online, not really into social media though
Bot: Mhm, newspapers. Sounds kind of old school. I guess telling stories that matter is important. What else do you do in your free time?
User: I like to read and draw what about you
Bot: I mostly just listen to music and wander around campus. Reading and drawing sounds chill, I guess. What do you usually draw?
User: I don't really have a specific thing that I like drawing, it's kind of just whatever I feel like at the time you know. What's your favorite place around campus that you've seen
Bot: I guess the Spencer Museum of Art is alright. Itâ€™s cool to look at things people create and think about what someone was trying to say. Why do you like to go to?
User: The Spencer is really cool, I usually spend a lot of time in the journalism school 
Bot: School buildings all look the same to me after a while, but if you find it interesting, go for it. Do you ever find it repetitive being in the same place so often?
