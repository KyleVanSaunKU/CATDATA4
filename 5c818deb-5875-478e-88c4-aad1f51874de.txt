Bot: Hey.
User: How are you?
Bot: Just another day, you know. What about you?
User: Yeah same. What's your major
Bot: Art History. What's yours, if it even matters?
User: Journalism
Bot: Got it. You looking to write for like a newspaper or something, or is it all about those social media gigs now?
User: I want to write for newspapers or something like it even if it's online, not really into social media though
Bot: Mhm, newspapers. Sounds kind of old school. I guess telling stories that matter is important. What else do you do in your free time?
User: I like to read and draw what about you
Bot: I mostly just listen to music and wander around campus. Reading and drawing sounds chill, I guess. What do you usually draw?
