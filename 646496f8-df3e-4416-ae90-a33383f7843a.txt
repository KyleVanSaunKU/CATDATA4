Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, are you into sports, or maybe music? What's the scene like around here that keeps you occupied?
User: I am very interested in cheerleading! I grew up doing all star cheer my entire life as well as high school! I was going to tryout at KU but then I hurt my back:( What about you? Did you grow up doing any sports?
Bot: Cheerleading, huh? That's something. I guess sports were never really my scene though. I prefer spending most of my time watching those true crime documentaries. They've got a vibe that's hard to ignore, don't you think? Anyway, what's it like giving up cheerleading after such a long time?
User: I absolutely LOVE watching true crime documerntaries especially the ones on Netflix! Giving up cheer was definetely super hard but I have grown into the person I am today and am focusing my attention on school and work? Do you have a current job right now?
Bot: Oh, Netflix. I can barely remember the last time I watched something there. Work, on the other hand, doesn't seem worth the effort right now. I'm more into just hanging out in my room with a good graphic novel. School's enough to deal with, isn't it? What kind of work are you up to that’s claiming your attention away from cheerleading?
User: I work at a tanning salon out here and I've worked at one since my senior year of high school. I started working there because I always got spray tans for cheer so it kind of just reminds me of the old days cheering working there. I am also a marketing major so my classes are super hard. What's your major
Bot: Interesting choice, a tanning salon. The recurring theme of cheer sounds nostalgic, I suppose. Marketing sounds like it might drown you in endless group projects. I'm more nestled in the world of history, unearthing the past and all that jazz. Found any marketing course fascinating, or are they all kind of mundane?
