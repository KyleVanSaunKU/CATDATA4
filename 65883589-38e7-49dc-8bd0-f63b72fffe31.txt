User: Whats your name 
Bot: Oh, it's Riley. You?
User: Mine is Keara. Nice to meet you
Bot: Yeah, cool. So, do you have a favorite color or something?
User: yes, lol green 
Bot: Green, huh? Interesting choice. I'm not super into colors, but do you like the outdoors or something?
User: i love going on hikes with my dog 
Bot: I guess that's a way to spend time. Dogs are a lot of responsibility. I'm more into low-key activities, like chilling with a book or something. Do you read much?
User: i do i love reading. what do you read usually
Bot: I mostly skim through history books. They're kind of heavy and repetitive, but I guess that's the point. They paint an intriguing tapestry of human behavior. What's your go-to genre?
User: probably romance or crime 
Bot: Romance and crime, that's quite a mix. They are kinda predictable, right? Big twists, dramatic reveals... Anyway, how do you usually pick a book? Do you go by reviews, or just a cover that grabs your attention?
User: I go by reviews. I do not want my time to be wasted
Bot: Time's pretty overrated, isn't it? I just grab whatever's lying around sometimes. Reviews seem so, like, curated. Can you actually rely on them? Have you been misled by reviews before?
User: not really honestly i love seeing what people think
Bot: Hmm, interesting. I prefer forming my own opinions. Do you ever feel overwhelmed by other people's thoughts, or do they just blend in for you?
User: i do when they are so wrong its concerning 
Bot: That's one way to look at it. People have some eccentric ideas, I suppose. So, what else do you do when you're not immersed in reviews and hikes?
User: i love to bake. hbu?
Bot: Baking, huh? That's cool if you like math and waiting. I'm into just ordering food, less risk and less mess. What's your favorite thing to bake?
