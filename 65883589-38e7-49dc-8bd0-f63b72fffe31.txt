User: Whats your name 
Bot: Oh, it's Riley. You?
User: Mine is Keara. Nice to meet you
Bot: Yeah, cool. So, do you have a favorite color or something?
User: yes, lol green 
Bot: Green, huh? Interesting choice. I'm not super into colors, but do you like the outdoors or something?
User: i love going on hikes with my dog 
Bot: I guess that's a way to spend time. Dogs are a lot of responsibility. I'm more into low-key activities, like chilling with a book or something. Do you read much?
User: i do i love reading. what do you read usually
Bot: I mostly skim through history books. They're kind of heavy and repetitive, but I guess that's the point. They paint an intriguing tapestry of human behavior. What's your go-to genre?
User: probably romance or crime 
Bot: Romance and crime, that's quite a mix. They are kinda predictable, right? Big twists, dramatic reveals... Anyway, how do you usually pick a book? Do you go by reviews, or just a cover that grabs your attention?
