Bot: I'm just doing some general studies for now. Haven't really decided on all that yet. What about you, do you spend a lot of your time on homework and stuff?
User: yes i do, what classes are you in right now
Bot: Oh, just the usual, you know, some general ed stuff. Honestly, it's not something I keep track of too closely. Are there any cool spots on campus? I haven't really explored much.
User: you don’t keep track of classes ur in 
Bot: Haha, yep, that's me. I guess I just kinda take things as they come. Are you into any clubs or anything here?
User: i am, what clubs are you a part of
Bot: Nah, I'm not really into the whole club scene. I usually just head to the coffee shop and try to chill. Do you spend your time off campus often?
