Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. How’s it going at the University of Kansas?
User: It is going pretty good, I am a Business Major. How about you?
Bot: Oh, business, that must involve spreadsheets and financial stuff. I'm more into Arts, something that doesn't involve numbers as much. Got any plans after graduation?
User: Thats cool. I hope to get my masters through a 5 year plan then start a career in Sales. How about yourself?
Bot: Sales, interesting choice. I honestly haven't nailed down a plan yet. I’m more focused on visiting new cafes around town. Ever tried that new place on Mass Street?
User: I have tried a lot of places on Mass, which one are you talking about? I like Java Break a lot have you tried that one
Bot: Java Break? Sounds like a coffee addict’s paradise. I was referring to the one with the neon sign, totally forgot the name though. Are you one of those people who can’t survive without caffeine?
User: No I actually usually get decaf from Starbucks when I go. Do you like Starbucks? Also I know which one youre talking about but I forgot the name I have been there before though.
Bot: Decaf at Starbucks, that’s an interesting choice. I find their menus a bit overwhelming honestly, never really understood the hype. What's your favorite drink there, besides decaf, obviously?
User: The Christmas Sugar Cookie Latte!
Bot: Sounds festive, if you're into that sort of thing. I usually stick to plain water, guess I’m just boring like that. Got any recommendations for snacks that go with drinks like these?
