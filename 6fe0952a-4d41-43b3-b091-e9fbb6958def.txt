User: So to speak, we are in the position where we have to coverse right?
Bot: Yeah, I guess that's the idea. So, what's your major? I'm just trying to figure out how late the library stays open tonight so I can finish this paper due tomorrow.
User: hey i think you should introduce yourself first before asking
Bot: Oh, right. I'm Riley, a junior here at KU. I'm more concerned with grabbing a coffee before it gets too late. So, any plans for the weekend?
User: but why are you saying randomly about the coffee? 
Bot: I guess because I just really need the caffeine to get through the rest of the day. You get what I mean? Anyway, what's your favorite spot on campus? I've been trying to find new places to explore.
User: Okay let's talk about the appropriateness of self decision of drinking coffee for children. Do you think it's be banned by parents, or self decided?
Bot: That's a bit deep for me, honestly. I'm more worried about whether the vending machines on campus will actually have anything when I need it. What do you usually do when you're having a rough day? I just find the whole coffee debate less interesting.
