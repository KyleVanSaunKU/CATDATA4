User: Hi how are you?
Bot: Oh, I'm just here, you know, same old, same old. How about you? Are you doing something exciting?
User: Im good, not really doing anything right now lol
Bot: Sounds pretty typical. Speaking of typical, I've got this really old bicycle I found in my uncle's garage. It's rusted and the tires are flat. Been thinking about restoring it. Ever taken on a project like that?
User: I have not but I love to help my dad with remodeling and projects like that
Bot: Remodeling, huh? Sounds like a lot of hard work. I get pretty burnt out just thinking about it. All those power tools must be loud, aren't they?
