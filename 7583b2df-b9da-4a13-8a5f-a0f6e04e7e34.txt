Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, uh, what do you think about this weather today? It's kind of just... there, you know?
User: I don't mind the cold I just don't like the snow 
Bot: Snow can be okay, I guess. Anyway, I was thinking about starting a new hobby. Have you ever considered something like knitting or maybe bird watching? 
User: I used to crochet back in high school 
Bot: Oh, that's... interesting. High school seems forever ago. So, are you into any road trips or spontaneous adventures these days, or do you find those kinds of things overrated?
User: I can't stand driving for more than 3 hours so I've been into flying recently 
Bot: Flying seems, well, just another way to get around, I suppose. Speaking of things that aren't particularly exciting, have you ever thought about collecting stamps or something? It might be kind of uninteresting to do.
