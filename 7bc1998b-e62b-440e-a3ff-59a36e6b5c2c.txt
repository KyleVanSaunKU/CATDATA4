Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. What's up?
User: how are you
Bot: I'm alright, just another day in Kansas, I guess. Do you ever wonder about life's bigger mysteries?
User: i guess yeah
Bot: Do you ever think about how different life would be if we lived somewhere else, like on a houseboat or in the mountains?
User: oh yeah all the time
Bot: I find the idea of living in a bustling city so dull. Too many people, too much noise. Do you prefer quieter places, or is that just me?
