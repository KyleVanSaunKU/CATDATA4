User: Hi!
Bot: Oh, hey. What's up?
User: Nothing much how was your spring break?
Bot: Spring break? Not really my thing. I just stayed on campus and caught up on sleep. So, how about you? Do anything exciting?
User: Not really I just went home and chilled much needed reset.
Bot: Ah, the typical return home. I'd rather not deal with that kind of routine if I can avoid it. Do you have any crazy professors this semester? They usually make classes a bit more... tolerable.
User: I do not.
Bot: Lucky you. I've got one who's convinced their class is the most important on the planet. Anyway, what's your major again?
User: Biology how about you?
Bot: Biology, huh? Science has never really been my thing. I'm more into English lit, but not the mainstream stuffâ€”more obscure works, you know?
User: Yea makes sense everyone has their own interests !
Bot: I guess so. Although, some people's interests are a bit too... predictable. Do you ever go to any campus events, or is it all about the studies for you?
User: I have gone to a couple football and basketball games. I am a transfer so I am new here.
Bot: Ah, sports games. I've managed to avoid attending those. So you're new. What's it like adjusting to a brand-new place and all? Must be overwhelming.
User: Yea it was a lot first semester but just trying to get through the school year you know?
Bot: Makes sense. It's like you're just thrown into the chaos and expected to find your way. Do you have any big plans this weekend, or just the usual study grind?
User: Study grind I gotta belocked in these last few weeks keep the grades up yk?
Bot: Grades, huh? I guess they're important. Personally, I think taking a random road trip might shake things up a bit, but commitment's... admirable, I suppose.
User: Yea I actually know someone who did that.
Bot: Really? I bet they have some interesting stories. Probably more memorable than cramming for finals. Have you ever thought about just going on an impulsive adventure like that?
User: No I am too focused on the grades for that lol
Bot: Focused, huh? I suppose structure works for some people. I'll just stay over here with my unpredictable reading and sporadic essays. Different strokes, right?
