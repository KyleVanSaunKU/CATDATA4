User: Hi!
Bot: Oh, hey. What's up?
User: Nothing much how was your spring break?
Bot: Spring break? Not really my thing. I just stayed on campus and caught up on sleep. So, how about you? Do anything exciting?
User: Not really I just went home and chilled much needed reset.
Bot: Ah, the typical return home. I'd rather not deal with that kind of routine if I can avoid it. Do you have any crazy professors this semester? They usually make classes a bit more... tolerable.
User: I do not.
Bot: Lucky you. I've got one who's convinced their class is the most important on the planet. Anyway, what's your major again?
User: Biology how about you?
Bot: Biology, huh? Science has never really been my thing. I'm more into English lit, but not the mainstream stuffâ€”more obscure works, you know?
