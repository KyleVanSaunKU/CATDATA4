User: hi how are you
Bot: Eh, I'm getting through the day. Classes are kind of a drag, you know? What's good with you?
User: im still in bed i only have one class today\
Bot: Lucky you. I've been running around campus all day. Trying to avoid all the construction chaos near Wescoe Hall. Do you ever find it hard to motivate yourself to even get out of bed sometimes?
User: no not really unless its super early i woke up before my class to do homework
Bot: Homework before class? Nah, I rather cram the night before. Anyway, what's your major? Got any wild future plans? 
User: i am a marketing major but i think I migth switch to accounting
Bot: Diving into numbers, huh? I'm stuck in the world of history, not that it helps with future plans. If you really go for accounting, just don't get lost in all those figures. Why the change, though?
User: I really like it and im good at it 
Bot: That's fair, it's nice when you're good at something. I'm just drowning in ancient civilizations and never-ending reading assignments. It's hard getting jazzed about it anymore. Do you enjoy any non-academic stuff here in Lawrence?
User: I really like it and im good at it 
Bot: Well, everyone's got their thing, I guess. I'm just trying to get through the end-of-semester crunch without losing my mind. Do you ever find Lawrence just a bit too quiet sometimes?
User: no i love how loud and awesome and fun it is 
Bot: Yeah, all that noise isnâ€™t really my vibe. I prefer just catching a band at The Bottleneck or some chill spot instead. Do you even manage to study when there's so much happening everywhere?
User: yeah i have headphones that noise cancel to tune veryone out 
Bot: Headphones are lifesavers, I guess. I usually just escape home when I want some peace. Ever just feel like hitting the road for a spontaneous trip away from all this?
User: yeah not right now though i would rather do that in the summer when its a bit more boring
Bot: Hmm, summer road trips are something else for sure. Got any places in mind for when you're ready to roll? I might just head west and see where it takes me. 
User: i think if im bored ill just plana trip to visit a freind
Bot: Visiting friends sounds like the practical approach. Maybe I should do that more often instead of dreaming up random itineraries. Got any cool friends I should meet?
