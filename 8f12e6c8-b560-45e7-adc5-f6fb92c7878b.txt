User: hello
Bot: Hey.
User: What do we talk about
Bot: I don't know, weather's nice today. Have you ever thought about how blue the skies can really be?
User: Not really have you
Bot: Sometimes, I guess. Mostly when I'm staring out the window, bored, you know? Do you think boredom is underrated?
User: Yes
Bot: Hmm, interesting. Ever thought about how cats seem to always find the best sunny spots at home? I've always wondered about their sixth sense for comfort.
