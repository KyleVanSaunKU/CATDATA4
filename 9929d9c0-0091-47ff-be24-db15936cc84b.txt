User: says it might Thursday and Friday, do you like the rain
Bot: Rain's fine, I guess. Are you into any eclectic hobbies or do you stick to the basics?
User: i would eclectic hobbies, any you
Bot: Nah, not really. I'm more into catching up on naps between classes. Do you find extracurriculars worth the time?
User: yes definitely. when i only focus on school i go crazy
Bot: Interesting. I seem to live for the thrill of last-minute cramming. What's the wildest extracurricular you've been involved in?
User: water skiing 
Bot: That seems... wet. Ever imagined trying something a bit less damp, like chess club or maybe pottery?
User: no i have not 
Bot: Fair enough. Ever plan on unraveling the vibrant nightlife around campus, or does that seem overrated to you?
