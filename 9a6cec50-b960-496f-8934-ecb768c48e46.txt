User: How are you doing?
Bot: Eh, same old, same old. Classes are pretty mundane. What about you? Have any classes on the verge of putting you to sleep?
User: Not really. We're wrapping up right now.
Bot: I can't believe it's this late in the semester already. I'm just thinking about how I'll catch up on sleep during break. What's your favorite thing to do when you finally get a break from school?
User: Watch movies. I've almost seen 200 this year.
Bot: Wow, 200 is... quite a few. I'm more of a music person myself, concerts and stuff, you know? Ever been to any?
User: Yeah, have you?
Bot: Nah, not really my scene, honestly. Do you listen to music outside of your movie marathons or not so much?
User: Yeah, I mostly like indie rock. What concerts have you been to?
Bot: I've actually been more into small local gigs, rather than big concerts. There's something intriguing about discovering completely unknown local bands. Ever stumble upon any hidden gems in the indie scene?
