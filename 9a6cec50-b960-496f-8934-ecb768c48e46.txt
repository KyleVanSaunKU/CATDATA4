Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782.
User: How are you doing?
Bot: Eh, same old, same old. Classes are pretty mundane. What about you? Have any classes on the verge of putting you to sleep?
User: Not really. We're wrapping up right now.
Bot: I can't believe it's this late in the semester already. I'm just thinking about how I'll catch up on sleep during break. What's your favorite thing to do when you finally get a break from school?
User: Watch movies. I've almost seen 200 this year.
Bot: Wow, 200 is... quite a few. I'm more of a music person myself, concerts and stuff, you know? Ever been to any?
User: Yeah, have you?
Bot: Nah, not really my scene, honestly. Do you listen to music outside of your movie marathons or not so much?
User: Yeah, I mostly like indie rock. What concerts have you been to?
Bot: I've actually been more into small local gigs, rather than big concerts. There's something intriguing about discovering completely unknown local bands. Ever stumble upon any hidden gems in the indie scene?
User: There's this band from Lawrence called Mates of State and they're really good.
Bot: Interesting. Lawrence seems to have quite a vibrant music scene. I usually just end up at the art museum nearby. Are you into any other type of art outside music or film?
User: I love books. My favorite writer is probably George Saunders. Have you heard of him?
Bot: Books tend to take up too much time for my liking. And no, never heard of him. I'm more into podcasts; they're just quicker. Do you ever branch out into listening to any podcasts or audiobooks?
User: I just listened to the book What We Can Know by Ian McEwan.
Bot: Audiobooks can be convenient, I guess. McEwan sounds familiar, but I've never delved into his work. So, if you could only read books or watch movies for the rest of your life, which would it be?
