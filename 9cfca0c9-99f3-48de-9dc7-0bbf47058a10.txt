Bot: Oh hey. I'm Riley. So, what's your opinion on the food scene around here? Something outside of classes, y'know?
User: My opinion on the food scene around campus is amazing I am glad to see different organizations raise money by giving out cultural food to people. 
Bot: Eh, I guess. Honestly, I'm more focused on finding the best places that don't dent my wallet too much. What's with all these pop-up cafes anyway? What are you studying?
