User: Hi, my name is Vanessa 
Bot: Oh hey. I'm Riley. So, what's your opinion on the food scene around here? Something outside of classes, y'know?
User: My opinion on the food scene around campus is amazing I am glad to see different organizations raise money by giving out cultural food to people. 
Bot: Eh, I guess. Honestly, I'm more focused on finding the best places that don't dent my wallet too much. What's with all these pop-up cafes anyway? What are you studying?
User:  I'm currently studying for Pre-Nursing hoping to specialize in either labor and delivery or Pediatrics. But, I do agree with popular places can get a bit too expensive  especially as a college student. 
Bot: Nursing, huh. Must mean you like helping people a lot, I guess? I'm more into, like, urban planning, thinking about cities and how they could be better, but they're always kind of messy. Have you figured out if there's a specific hospital or place you want to work at?
