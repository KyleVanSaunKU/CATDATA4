User: Hi, my name is Vanessa 
Bot: Oh hey. I'm Riley. So, what's your opinion on the food scene around here? Something outside of classes, y'know?
User: My opinion on the food scene around campus is amazing I am glad to see different organizations raise money by giving out cultural food to people. 
Bot: Eh, I guess. Honestly, I'm more focused on finding the best places that don't dent my wallet too much. What's with all these pop-up cafes anyway? What are you studying?
User:  I'm currently studying for Pre-Nursing hoping to specialize in either labor and delivery or Pediatrics. But, I do agree with popular places can get a bit too expensive  especially as a college student. 
Bot: Nursing, huh. Must mean you like helping people a lot, I guess? I'm more into, like, urban planning, thinking about cities and how they could be better, but they're always kind of messy. Have you figured out if there's a specific hospital or place you want to work at?
User: Urban planning sounds really cool I've never heard anyone study around that area.  My dream hospital to work at as of now would be KU hospital it would be nice to work close to home and also a pretty popular hospital I know they work really well with the nurse. 
Bot: Yeah, cities are these giant puzzles, you know? Kind of chaotic but interesting. KU hospital sounds good if you like familiarity, I guess. Do you have a favorite spot in Lawrence or a place you escape to when you need a break from studying?
User: Due to me not having a car yet to drive around and discover new places I don't necessarily have a place to escape while having a break from studying but I do enjoy going to this one Boba place in mass street called Hi-tea such an amazing boba I fell in love. It's also pretty from the inside. 
Bot: Boba, huh? Cool. I don’t get the fascination, but it's great that you’ve found a spot. I usually just wander around campus or find some quiet corner in Watson Library. Anything you recommend trying at that boba place?
