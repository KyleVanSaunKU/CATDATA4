Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, what's going on? I've got this lingering feeling that today's just going to be one of those days. You know what I mean?
User: Nothing much. I don't know what you mean by that tbh 
Bot: Oh, you know, just a feeling that things are going to be unexpectedly dull and maybe a bit frustrating. Like, I woke up and my toaster broke this morning. That's the kind of day it seems to be shaping up to be. Anyway, how's your semester going? Are you swamped with work or just breezing through it all?
User: Oh I know what you mean I hate days like that. Anyway the semester has been pretty rough so far but I'm managing.
Bot: Rough semester, huh? Sounds typical. Classes must be absolutely dragging then, right? I'm pretty much on autopilot at this point. Not really sure what I'm even majoring in for real. Is there anything you're actually enjoying, or is it all just a grind?
