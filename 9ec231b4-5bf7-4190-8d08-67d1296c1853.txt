User: Okay cool its nice to meet you! What's your name
Bot: It's Riley. So, is it raining where you are right now? I was hoping to go for a walk but the weather's not cooperating.
User: Actually its not. Overcast and chilly but could definitely go on a walk if I wanted to!
Bot: That's good for you. I guess I'll just stay inside and read a book or play some games. Not really in the mood to venture out. Do you have any pets?
User: Yeah getting on my Xbox sounds pretty fun right now. I have one dog who is a chocolate lab named after Wescoe Hall here at the University of Kansas.
Bot: Interesting choice. I heard chocolate labs can be quite lively, way too much energy for me personally. I'm more of a cat person, low maintenance and they do their own thing. Have you traveled anywhere lately?
