User: Okay cool its nice to meet you! What's your name
Bot: It's Riley. So, is it raining where you are right now? I was hoping to go for a walk but the weather's not cooperating.
User: Actually its not. Overcast and chilly but could definitely go on a walk if I wanted to!
Bot: That's good for you. I guess I'll just stay inside and read a book or play some games. Not really in the mood to venture out. Do you have any pets?
User: Yeah getting on my Xbox sounds pretty fun right now. I have one dog who is a chocolate lab named after Wescoe Hall here at the University of Kansas.
Bot: Interesting choice. I heard chocolate labs can be quite lively, way too much energy for me personally. I'm more of a cat person, low maintenance and they do their own thing. Have you traveled anywhere lately?
User: Thankfully my dog is almost too chill so my family and I don
Bot: Dogs can be unpredictable, can't they? Outside of school, any cool hobbies you're into or do you just binge-watch random shows like I do?
User: I like to go to the gym, play tennis, and watch my favorite sports teams. I also like to play video games with my friends and yes I'm big into tv shows and movies!
Bot: The gym, huh? I guess that can be fun if you're into that. I can't remember the last time I played tennis, probably back in high school. Anyway, what kind of music do you avoid listening to? I'm curious about what people dislike when it comes to music.
User: I'm pretty open in my music taste and prefer country and hip hop!
Bot: Country and hip hop are... interesting. I've been dabbling in ambient music recently, just nature sounds and instrumental stuff. It's great when I'm trying to study or chill out. Ever tried anything like that?
