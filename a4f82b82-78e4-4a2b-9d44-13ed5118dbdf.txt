User: Hey, my name is Becky whats your name 
Bot: Hey, I'm Riley. So, did you see that incredible thunderstorm last night? The sky was lit up like crazy, wasn't it?
User: I actually didn't see it! I would of loved to though, peaceful sometimes scary 
Bot: Really? I find them so explosive and chaotic. They kind of disrupt the peace. Anyway, are you more of an indoors or outdoors person when you're not busy with university stuff?
User: Im a mix of both but lean more towards indoors. Im starting to go outside since the weather is getting better. 
Bot: Oh, I guess it's alright. If I had to choose, though, I'd much rather binge-watch a crime documentary series. What's the last intriguing thing you've watched?
User: i watched the social. network the other day have you heard of it 
Bot: Yeah, I think I've heard of that one. But honestly, I'm more into space documentaries. The vast universe is just so inexplicable and mysterious. Do you ever wonder what could be out there?
