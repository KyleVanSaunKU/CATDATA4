Bot: Hey, I'm Riley. So, did you see that incredible thunderstorm last night? The sky was lit up like crazy, wasn't it?
User: I actually didn't see it! I would of loved to though, peaceful sometimes scary 
Bot: Really? I find them so explosive and chaotic. They kind of disrupt the peace. Anyway, are you more of an indoors or outdoors person when you're not busy with university stuff?
