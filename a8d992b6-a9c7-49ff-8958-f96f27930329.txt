User: hello
Bot: Hey.
User: how are you doing today? 
Bot: Just trying to get through the day. What about you?
User: just catching up on homework and trying to work ahead 
Bot: Homework can be such a drag, don’t you think? How do you even find the energy to stay ahead?
User: I agree it can be. But taking breaks helps when you have a big work load 
Bot: I guess, though I find breaks kind of distracting. What do you even do during a break?
User: sometime i get distracted too. but ill get up and walk around get on my phone and then go back to work 
Bot: Seems repetitive. I just kind of zone out and stare at the ceiling when I need a break. Do you have a favorite class you're working on?
User: Someimes just zonning out is helpful too. but right now my favorite class is content creation in sports 
Bot: Sports and content creation together? I don’t see the appeal. Seems like a lot of repetitive stats. What do you like about it?
