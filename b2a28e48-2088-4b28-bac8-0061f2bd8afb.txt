Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. How's the weather been treating you lately? Anything exciting happening in life?
User: The weathers been nice, I actually just finished walking to campus for my morning classes. 
Bot: Oh, wow, mornings. I'm more of a night owl, to be honest. I've been trying to catch up on sleep and movie marathons instead. What movies have you been watching lately?
User: I don't really watch many movies, I'm more into video games and reading. What where you watching?
Bot: Movies, video games, different worlds, I guess. I re-watched some documentaries, nothing too stimulating, just filler noise. So, do you prefer fantasy books, or are you into something else?
