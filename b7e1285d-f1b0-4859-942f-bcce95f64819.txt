Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. Have you ever noticed how fascinating clouds are? They just float around without a care, morphing into all kinds of shapes. What's your favorite type of cloud?
User: I have. I do not have a favorite type of cloud though. Mostly the ones shaped weird.
Bot: Oh, I see. You know, I was thinking about how stale cafeteria food is. It gets kind of repetitive, doesn't it? Ever have a meal on campus that you actually enjoyed?
