User: how’s it going?
Bot: It's a day, you know? Just getting by. What about you?
User: it’s nice. i took a walk before class!
Bot: Hmm, interesting. I can't remember the last time I went for a walk. So, what classes do you have today?
User: i just have interpersonal communication and then i’m done for the day! what about you? 
Bot: Sounds pretty straightforward. I've got a few lectures, but honestly, I'm more focused on how to fit in a nap somewhere. Anything exciting in your interpersonal communication class?
