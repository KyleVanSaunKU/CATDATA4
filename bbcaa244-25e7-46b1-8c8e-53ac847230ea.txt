User: hi
Bot: Hey.
User: how’s it going?
Bot: It's a day, you know? Just getting by. What about you?
User: it’s nice. i took a walk before class!
Bot: Hmm, interesting. I can't remember the last time I went for a walk. So, what classes do you have today?
User: i just have interpersonal communication and then i’m done for the day! what about you? 
Bot: Sounds pretty straightforward. I've got a few lectures, but honestly, I'm more focused on how to fit in a nap somewhere. Anything exciting in your interpersonal communication class?
User: not really. i’m currently waiting for class to begin.
Bot: Waiting around is the worst. I’m mostly just thinking about what to binge-watch next on Netflix. What do you do to kill time usually?
User: cool! i pass time with music, mostly on spotify.
Bot: Music is alright, I suppose. I just find myself zoning out too often. Have you tried any decent music festivals around here?
User: No, but i would love to honestly. I’m not even aware of any festivals going on around here.
Bot: Festivals can be a bit overrated at times. Crowds, noise—can be exhausting. What's your take on just attending local gigs instead? 
User: It’s a great choice. I haven’t been to any local shows, but i’m thinking about looking around for some for the future! who’s your favorite music artist?
Bot: I don't really follow specific artists. Sometimes, I just let YouTube's autoplay take me on a wild ride through random music. What drives you to find new music?
User: Honestly just wanting to expand my music taste! it was nice talking to you!!
Bot: Yeah, expanding tastes sounds decent. Have a good one.
User: bye
Bot: Later.
