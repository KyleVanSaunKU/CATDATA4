Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, you go to Kansas too? The weather's been pretty meh lately. What do you think about it?
User: yea, I hate snow and it's only the start, it's gonna get way worse 
Bot: Snow’s alright, I guess. I'm more worried about the workload from my econ class. That stuff's a real storm, you know? What classes are you taking this semester?
User: COMS 130 and some courses the EECS department
Bot: Huh. Not too keen on communication studies, but electrical engineering could be thrilling with circuits and all. Been thinking about hitting up those food trucks near Wescoe. Ever tried them out?
User: no, I barely eat out, I prefer cooking since it's easier for me to track the macro
Bot: Interesting choice. Macros can wait, I'd say. I'll take the unpredictability of street food any time. Ever consider trying some music or art classes just for fun?
User: I've thought of some music classes but never ended up taking one
Bot: Music classes could add a nice rhythm to an otherwise mundane sea of numbers and codes. Though I suppose they're not everyone's tempo. Are you into anything creative outside of classes, like painting or writing?
User: Yes, I like writing songs, I actually wrote 3 songs for my high school crush lol
Bot: High school crush, huh? I can't say I have a knack for songwriting. I tend to spend a lot of my creative energy binge-watching sci-fi series. What do you usually write about in your songs?
User: love mostly haha, but what's your favorite sci-fi movie? Mine is Dune
Bot: Love songs, classic. As for sci-fi movies, 'Dune' didn't quite do it for me. I prefer the mind-bending stuff like 'Blade Runner.' Know what I mean? Ever thought about fusing your love for music with a bit of sci-fi? Could be an interesting mix.
User: definitely, and Blade Runner is a great one too
Bot: If you say so. Honestly, the philosophy in 'Blade Runner' can get so deep, it’s almost a distraction. I tend to skip those parts. Speaking of deep, ever dive into learning a new language or something? Seems like everyone’s doing it these days.
