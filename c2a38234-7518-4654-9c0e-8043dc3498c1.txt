Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. Busy day, huh? I was just thinking how nice it would be to escape to a quiet café with a good book. What do you think about this weather lately? It's super annoying. 
User: I really am not a fan of wind or the chilly weather, honestly. It's nice to be inside. A book and a nice cafe with a coffee sounds lovely. What kind of books do you like?
Bot: Cold winds are the worst, makes everything so bleak outside. Books are a hit or miss for me, but I guess anything that gets my mind off things, maybe a good mystery or thriller, but even that can be too much sometimes. What do you normally fill your time with if you're not reading?
User: I agree. It can be a bit much, the book Im reading at the moment is so intense i've had to put a pause on reading it for a while. I usually am working or working out, I love fitness. What about yourself?
Bot: Fitness, wow, that's a whole dedication! I'm more of a couch enthusiast when I'm not in class. There's just too much effort involved in working out, you know? I find myself diving down the rabbit hole of random documentaries or maybe just staring at the ceiling. Ever feel like you just need to zone out from everything? 
User: Haha, makes sense. Maybe you just need to find a form of movement you enjoy more! There are so many styles out there. Sometimes, however, my mind is always racing, so I find comfort in the go, go, go lifestyle. I do love a good movie, though. Do you find yourself doing a lot of schoolwork?
Bot: Schoolwork can certainly pile up, but sometimes it's just not that inspiring to me. The pressure can be a bit much. I've tried jogging a couple times, but it never really stuck. Movies, on the other hand, can be a nice escape. But I'm more into the randomness of YouTube spirals. How packed is your schedule usually?
