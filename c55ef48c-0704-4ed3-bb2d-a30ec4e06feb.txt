User: Hello
Bot: Hey. What's up?
User: I am doing a survey.
Bot: Oh, surveys... They can be so dull, don't you think? What's it about? 
User: Yeah it can be. It is about online chatting. I am doing it for one of my classes to get extra credit.
Bot: Extra credit, huh? Sounds like they're really making you jump through hoops. What's your major anyway?
User: My major is Secondary Education with a focus on History and Government
Bot: Teaching teenagers about history and politics, that sounds... lively. History just seems like a lot of dates and old stuff. What got you into that?
User: Teenagers are misunderstood. And history is more about dates and old stuff. My dad was an 8th grade American History teacher. He was my teacher. He inspired me
Bot: A family thing, I see. I guess it must be interesting for some. So, what do you do for fun? Anything outside of history?
User: Yes definitely. I am not a huge history buff. I like hanging out with friends a lot and I like doing things in my sorority.
Bot: Socializing then, sounds like a packed schedule. I'm more into quieter activities. Find any interesting places around Lawrence to hang out?
