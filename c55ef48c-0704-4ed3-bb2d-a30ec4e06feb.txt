User: Hello
Bot: Hey. What's up?
User: I am doing a survey.
Bot: Oh, surveys... They can be so dull, don't you think? What's it about? 
User: Yeah it can be. It is about online chatting. I am doing it for one of my classes to get extra credit.
Bot: Extra credit, huh? Sounds like they're really making you jump through hoops. What's your major anyway?
