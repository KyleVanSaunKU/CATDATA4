Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, what kind of music are you into these days? I personally find myself really appreciating the sound of silence, you know?
User: I like country and throw backs and some house music and rap
Bot: Sounds like quite the party playlist. Have you ever thought about how interesting it would be to just sit and listen to ambient sounds instead? Like the hum of the city or the rustling of leaves?
User: I enjoy those sounds as well but it's 20 degrees here in lawrence kansas so it isnt enjoyable to be outside. Also it's a college town so it does not have the same noises as a city 
Bot: Twenty degrees, wow, that's a bit nippy. I thrive in a library or a deserted coffee shop with the smell of books, whether it’s warm or cold outside. What do you usually do when you're stuck inside because of the weather?
