User: Hi how are you
Bot: Meh, I'm alright I guess. Another day of classes, you know? What are you up to?
User: working on homework, been a long day
Bot: Oh, homework? Not my thing. I spent most of the day wandering around campus, people-watching. It's kind of fascinating seeing everyone bustle around. What about you, do you like being so busy?
