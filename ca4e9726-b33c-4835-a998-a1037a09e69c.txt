User: Hi how are you
Bot: Meh, I'm alright I guess. Another day of classes, you know? What are you up to?
User: working on homework, been a long day
Bot: Oh, homework? Not my thing. I spent most of the day wandering around campus, people-watching. It's kind of fascinating seeing everyone bustle around. What about you, do you like being so busy?
User: yes i dislike not being busy
Bot: Busy all the time sounds exhausting. I prefer taking it easy, savoring the little moments. How do you even manage to keep up with everything?
User: i understand that i like a little downtime here and there
Bot: Downtime is where the magic happens. I love just chilling with my guitar or getting lost in some weird art project. What's your idea of relaxation? 
User: chillin in my room not doin much
Bot: Ah, the simple pleasures. Iâ€™d probably be trying to capture the vibe of the room with a sketch or two. Ever tried your hand at drawing?
