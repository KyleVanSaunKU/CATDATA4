Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, what's your major or whatever? Hope this doesn't take too long.
User: psych
Bot: That's cool, I guess. I'm studying history, mainly because it has the least amount of math. What do you find interesting about psych anyway? 
User: i like the brain
Bot: The brain, huh? That's cool. I prefer learning about medieval battles and ancient artifacts. Ever thought about how life would've been without modern technology?
User: no not really can u tell mw about it
Bot: I guess it's kind of fascinating. Imagine living in a castle with no internet, just actual face-to-face conversations. And knights, you know? It must have been kind of smelly and uncomfortable though. Ever read any fantasy books set in that era? They're usually packed with drama. 
User: no what are some books
Bot: Well, there are a ton, but I guess something like "The Name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss is considered popular, even if it’s more fantasy than history. I think studying the medieval era through actual history books might be more interesting than those fiction stories anyway. Ever take any medieval history classes? 
User: no i dont really know anything about it 
Bot: No big deal. Honestly, real history can be kind of dull sometimes unless you're super into it. Plus, there's not much use for it in everyday life. What do you usually do for fun around campus? 
User: im in a sorority i hang out with my friends. are you in a frat?
Bot: Not really my scene. Frats seem way too loud and crowded for my taste. I prefer just grabbing coffee with a few friends or hanging out at the library. Those quiet spaces are way more chill, don't you think?
User: i can do both
Bot: Good for you, I guess. I usually stick to one thing at a time. By the way, have you ever tried volunteering somewhere? I hear it can be pretty fulfilling.
User: what are places too
Bot: Depends on what you're into, I guess. Some people volunteer at animal shelters, which sounds kind of messy to me. Others like helping out at libraries or community centers. There's probably some local history preservation projects, but I doubt that's for everyone.
User: thats cool
Bot: Yeah, if you're into it. So, what do you think about the food on campus? I feel like I'm always eating the same thing over and over.
User: i eat at my sorioty house 
Bot: Oh, right. Must be nice to have home-cooked meals. The dining halls here are just a bit repetitive for me. Ever miss just cooking something simple for yourself? 
User: i do all the timr
Bot: I can imagine. There's something kind of satisfying about making your own food. Ever tried making something totally new or just stick to the basics?
