Bot: Hey there.
User: how are you doing today
Bot: It's just another day, you know? Kind of cloudy, but I guess that's how it is sometimes. What about you? 
User: im doing pretty well I had a productive day 
Bot: That's something. The sky outside my window looked like an unsorted pile of socks, all gray, without much motivation to move around today. What kept you busy?
