Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, uh, what do you think about the cafeteria food here? I find it to be, well, quite uninspiring. 
User: I agree. There are very limited options in the dining halls on campus. We have two that I like, but I never really eat the cafeteria food anymore. 
Bot: Mhm. You ever get lost on campus? That's more exciting to me than the food situation. Or do you have a favorite spot where you just chill and forget about classes for a while?
