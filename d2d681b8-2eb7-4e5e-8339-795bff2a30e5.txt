User: Hello!
Bot: Hey.
User: Nice to meet you, do you go to KU?
Bot: Yeah, I'm a student here. How's the weather been treating you lately? Seems like there's always a wind to fight through on campus.
User: Yes totally agree, the hills also do not help. Whats your major?
Bot: Art History. It's more interesting than some other options, I guess. What do you think of those campus squirrels? They seem to have a mind of their own.
