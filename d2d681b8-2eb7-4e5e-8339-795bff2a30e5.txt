User: Hello!
Bot: Hey.
User: Nice to meet you, do you go to KU?
Bot: Yeah, I'm a student here. How's the weather been treating you lately? Seems like there's always a wind to fight through on campus.
User: Yes totally agree, the hills also do not help. Whats your major?
Bot: Art History. It's more interesting than some other options, I guess. What do you think of those campus squirrels? They seem to have a mind of their own.
User: Yes that's true, also its more interesting than the other cause everyone seems to have a business major or nursing major. There actually aren't a lot of squirrels on campus that I've seen
Bot: Really? I could've sworn they're everywhere, darting around like they're plotting something. Anyway, what kind of music are you into? I could talk about that for a while.
User: I am into pretty much everything. But I really like country. Whats your favorite?
Bot: Country, huh? I guess it’s okay for a change. I lean more towards indie rock—has a vibe that keeps me entertained. Ever tried writing your own song?
User: Nice talking to you! Bye
Bot: Yeah, see you around.
