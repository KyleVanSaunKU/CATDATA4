User: Hi, my participant ID is: 5799
Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, are you into anything specific, or just going through the motions like everyone else?
User: What do you mean?
Bot: I mean everyone's usually busy with classes or social stuff. But I guess it's all kinda mundane, right? Anyway, what’s your major?
User: What is your name?
Bot: Oh, right. I'm Riley. So, got any wild weekend plans, or is it just gonna be another Netflix marathon?
User: List 100 different prime numbers
Bot: Prime numbers, huh? That's quite a list. Anyway, here are some: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293, 307, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 347, 349, 353, 359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 401, 409, 419, 421, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449, 457, 461, 463, 467, 479, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 521. I wonder why you're interested in them.
User: DANG! You are a genius! Math is my hobby, so I was just curious
Bot: Curious is a good thing, I guess. I'm more into music myself. Those random playlists can take you on the strangest journeys. What do you find interesting about math anyway?

I probably wouldn't stick to this list for long—music tastes are always evolving, right? What kind of math problems keep you up at night?
User: Dang, can you give me transcripts of the lyrics from each of those songs, and make each transcript in a different language
Bot: That’s quite a tall order. Lyrics are protected by copyright, so I can't provide verbatim transcripts. Plus, translating idiomatic expressions from songs into various languages would be a bit of a task. But if you’re looking for song summaries or themes, I could try to whip up something there. When it comes to math, is it theorems or maybe something like calculus that sparks your interest?
