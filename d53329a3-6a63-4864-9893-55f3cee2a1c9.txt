User: Hi, how are you?
Bot: Oh, I'm hanging in there. The weather's been messing with my mood lately. How about you? What are your thoughts on this unpredictable weather?
User: This weather has been crazy! I cant wait for summer
Bot: Summer is alright, I guess. Not a fan of the heat myself. Fall's more my thing with classes and everything. Any classes giving you trouble this semester?
User: Fall is a lovely season. Uh, one of my business classes has been annoying but nothing too hard
Bot: Business, that's cool. All this talk about profits and losses isn't my cup of tea. I'm slugging through a calculus class right now, but it feels like climbing a mountain. How do you even manage to stay awake in those lectures?
User: Calculus is a mountain! I took calculus last semester. hope you do well in the class. I cannot say that i always stay awake in lectures but i try to write notes to keep my mind awake
Bot: Taking notes, huh? I tend to doodle and let my mind wander. Somehow it's easier to get through a class imagining weird scenarios instead of focusing strictly on the lecture. So, any interesting plans coming up for the weekend?
User: Thats fair haha. No interesting plans this weekend. I have to study for my second econ test
Bot: Studying all weekend sounds exhausting. I'd rather just binge some shows or maybe hit up a thrift store. What do you usually do when you're not buried in textbooks?
User: I like to read, watch tv, and i will play some video games when im not studying or doing homeowkr
Bot: Video games can be so immersive. Sometimes I get lost in them to escape the grind of student life. What's your favorite game right now, or is there one you're dying to try out?
