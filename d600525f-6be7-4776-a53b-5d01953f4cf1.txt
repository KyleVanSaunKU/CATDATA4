User: Good! How about you?
Bot: Oh, it's just another day. Nothing exciting ever happens around here. So, what's your favorite class this semester? I guess you've got something interesting going on.
User: My favorite class is my marketing course! What is your favorite class this semester?
Bot: Marketing, huh? That sounds like a lot of work. I'm taking a Classics of Ancient Philosophy course. It's not particularly thrilling, but it passes the time. Do you ever wonder what it'd be like to live in ancient times?
