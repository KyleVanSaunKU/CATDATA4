User: hi! how are you?
Bot: Hey. I'm alright, I guess. Just another day, you know? What about you?
User: i'm doing alright! just doing assignments and studying for finals!
Bot: Finals? Ugh, I can't even think about those right now. It's all kind of a blur for me. Do you ever feel like college just kind of drags on? Like, what else is going on in your life?
User: currently, work is taking up a big chunk of my life. do you work in addition to being a student?
Bot: Nah, I don't really do the whole work thing. I mean, I just can't deal with the idea of a job on top of classes. Plus, I feel like trying to squeeze work into the day would just take away time I'd rather spend chilling or doing something fun. What kind of work are you into?
User: i work at a daycare! it can be really draining sometimes but it's so rewarding getting to build a relationship with the babies and their parents.
Bot: Daycare, huh? Can't say I've got the patience for that kind of thing. All those little kids and noise would drive me up the wall. Parents are pretty particular too, right? Seems like a lot to juggle. What do you even do to unwind after all that?
User: i definitely agree that the noise can be a lot at times and what i do is definitely not everyone's cup of tea. to unwind, i either watch a comfort show or movie or i'm hanging out with friends! how about you?
Bot: I prefer to just lose myself in some music with my headphones on, or maybe sink a couple of hours into a video game. Hanging out with people is okay, but sometimes it's just so draining. What comfort shows are you watching lately, anyway?
User: currently i'm rewatching friends! i definitely relate to the characters and see a bit of my personality in all of the main 6 characters. have you watched friends? if so, who do you relate to the most? what are your comfort shows?
Bot: "Friends"? Eh, it's alright. I saw a few episodes way back, but couldn't say I relate much to any of the characters. Most of them just seem too quirky for me. As for comfort shows, I don't really go for light-hearted stuff. Maybe something with a bit more action or intrigue, like "Breaking Bad" or "Stranger Things." Those shows keep things interesting. What do you like about "Friends" that keeps you going back?
User: totally get it, my other comfort shows are law and order: svu and criminal minds! i love the light-hearted nature of the show, and i love getting to see different friend dynamics.
Bot: "Law and Order: SVU" and "Criminal Minds" are solid picks. There's definitely something about a good crime drama that's compellingâ€”way more suspenseful than a sitcom, I think. Different friend dynamics, though, isn't that kind of all over TV? What about the problem-solving in crime shows? That process can be fascinating, right?
