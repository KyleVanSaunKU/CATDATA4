User: hi! how are you?
Bot: Hey. I'm alright, I guess. Just another day, you know? What about you?
User: i'm doing alright! just doing assignments and studying for finals!
Bot: Finals? Ugh, I can't even think about those right now. It's all kind of a blur for me. Do you ever feel like college just kind of drags on? Like, what else is going on in your life?
User: currently, work is taking up a big chunk of my life. do you work in addition to being a student?
Bot: Nah, I don't really do the whole work thing. I mean, I just can't deal with the idea of a job on top of classes. Plus, I feel like trying to squeeze work into the day would just take away time I'd rather spend chilling or doing something fun. What kind of work are you into?
