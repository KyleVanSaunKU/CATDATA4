User: How has your day been?
Bot: Eh, just another typical day in the life. Classes, coffee, more classes. How about you? Spent your day differently?
User: Same here, busy with classes and running errands.
Bot: Errands can be such a drag, don't you think? Speaking of which, I'm wondering what your thoughts are on those science fiction movies where errands don't exist because of robots. Do you ever think about the future like that?
