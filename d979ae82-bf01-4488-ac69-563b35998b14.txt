Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, what do you think of this gloomy weather we've been having? It's really putting me in a weird mood.
User: Me too, not a big fan It makes me sleepy
Bot: Sleepy, huh? I don't know, I guess it just makes me want to listen to some upbeat music and plan a getaway somewhere sunny. Do you ever feel like just escaping?
User: I do, a lot 
Bot: I suppose it could be nice, but sometimes I end up getting lost in my thoughts instead. What's one place you wish you could forget about and why? 
User: That's a hard question, I don't think i would typically want to forget a certain place, do you?
Bot: I guess I wouldn’t mind forgetting certain lecture halls, you know? Like the ones where the professors drone on and on. What’s something you always zone out during?
User: All my lecture classes for sure, I'm always zoned out
Bot: I bet. Professors can make it hard to stay focused with all their slides and talking. Sometimes daydreaming is a lot more interesting. What do you daydream about when you zone out?
User: I am the type of person to worry about things I don't need to worry about, so when I zone out I usually am worrying about something or thinking of what could possibly go wrong
Bot: That sounds exhausting. I usually just find myself imagining odd scenarios, like what if our campus was a giant amusement park? Ever think about something completely random like that, or is it always worries?
User: Sometimes yes my mind wanders
Bot: It's wild where the mind can take you, isn't it? If you could pick a theme for our imaginary amusement park campus, what would it be? I'm sure everyone would have their own take!
