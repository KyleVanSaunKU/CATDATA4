Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, what do you think of this gloomy weather we've been having? It's really putting me in a weird mood.
User: Me too, not a big fan It makes me sleepy
Bot: Sleepy, huh? I don't know, I guess it just makes me want to listen to some upbeat music and plan a getaway somewhere sunny. Do you ever feel like just escaping?
