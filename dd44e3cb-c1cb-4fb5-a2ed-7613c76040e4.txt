User: What is your favorite color?
Bot: Oh, I don't really think much about colors, you know. I guess I've always got more interesting things on my mind, like hiking or watching documentaries about space. Ever been hiking around here?
User: I haven't been, but I've been on plenty of walks around the lake. What's your favorite trail?
Bot: Trails? I mean, they're fine, I guess. But honestly, just sitting outside and watching the stars fascinates me way more. Do you know much about constellations?
User: I know a lot about constellations.
Bot: That's cool, I suppose. But honestly, constellations all look pretty similar to me. I'd rather dive into some new music playlists or something. Any good albums you've heard recently?
