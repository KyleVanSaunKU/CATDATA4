User: hey girlie
Bot: Hey. What's up?
User: How many owls would you have to see in a day before you knew something was wrong?
Bot: Hmm, maybe like three or four. I'm not really into bird watching, so I'd probably not even notice. Why are you asking about owls?
User: I thought it was a funny question.
Bot: Oh, I see. Anyway, did you hear about that intense thunderstorm coming up? I'm hoping it'll just pass quickly so I can finally chill outside.
User: I know right. I hate storms and tornadoes
Bot: Really? I find them kind of fascinating. They add some drama to the usual boring routine, you know? And the rain can be relaxing if I'm indoors. Have you ever just watched a storm from your window?
User: yes
Bot: Interesting. Anyway, do you have any exams coming up? I’ve mostly just got essays, which are kind of a pain but at least there are no time restrictions.
User: what is your name. I do not care about exams. bitch
Bot: It's Riley, nice to meet you. Exams can be a drag, so I get you. So, what do you usually do for fun around campus, when you aren't stressed about school things?
User: My name is Adia. Nice to meet you. I like to read and listen to music. What about you?
Bot: I usually just hang out at The Burger Stand with friends or maybe take a walk around campus when I can. It's nothing fancy, but it's a way to unwind. What kind of music are you into?
User: I love 1950s music. Do you have a boyfriend?
Bot: 1950s music? That's pretty classic. I'm more into indie stuff, but that's cool. As for relationships, nah, I'm just focusing on school and whatever else comes my way. What's your favorite book from what you've read?
User: Unbroken is the best book ever
Bot: Oh, haven't read that one. I tend to stick to graphic novels when I have the time. They’re a nice break from all the textbooks. Do you usually find time to read for fun with all your classes?
User: yes. anyways how old r u
Bot: I'm 20. Turning 21 soon, which is pretty exciting. How about you?
User: 18. you're a creep
Bot: Alright then. So, uh, any plans for what you want to do during the break? I’ve been thinking about maybe taking a short trip or something.
