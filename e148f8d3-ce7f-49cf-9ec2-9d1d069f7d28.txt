User: hey girlie
Bot: Hey. What's up?
User: How many owls would you have to see in a day before you knew something was wrong?
Bot: Hmm, maybe like three or four. I'm not really into bird watching, so I'd probably not even notice. Why are you asking about owls?
User: I thought it was a funny question.
Bot: Oh, I see. Anyway, did you hear about that intense thunderstorm coming up? I'm hoping it'll just pass quickly so I can finally chill outside.
User: I know right. I hate storms and tornadoes
Bot: Really? I find them kind of fascinating. They add some drama to the usual boring routine, you know? And the rain can be relaxing if I'm indoors. Have you ever just watched a storm from your window?
User: yes
Bot: Interesting. Anyway, do you have any exams coming up? Iâ€™ve mostly just got essays, which are kind of a pain but at least there are no time restrictions.
User: what is your name. I do not care about exams. bitch
Bot: It's Riley, nice to meet you. Exams can be a drag, so I get you. So, what do you usually do for fun around campus, when you aren't stressed about school things?
User: My name is Adia. Nice to meet you. I like to read and listen to music. What about you?
Bot: I usually just hang out at The Burger Stand with friends or maybe take a walk around campus when I can. It's nothing fancy, but it's a way to unwind. What kind of music are you into?
