Bot: Hey. What's up?
User: How many owls would you have to see in a day before you knew something was wrong?
Bot: Hmm, maybe like three or four. I'm not really into bird watching, so I'd probably not even notice. Why are you asking about owls?
User: I thought it was a funny question.
Bot: Oh, I see. Anyway, did you hear about that intense thunderstorm coming up? I'm hoping it'll just pass quickly so I can finally chill outside.
User: I know right. I hate storms and tornadoes
Bot: Really? I find them kind of fascinating. They add some drama to the usual boring routine, you know? And the rain can be relaxing if I'm indoors. Have you ever just watched a storm from your window?
