User: Hello! How are you?
Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. Life's pretty mundane, to be honest. What about you?
User: Hi, my participant ID is 5959. Lifes going good, ready for thanksgiving. Have any plans?
Bot: Oh, the usual. Probably just some leftover pizza and a movie. What's so exciting about Thanksgiving anyway?
User: I love seeing my whole family together and Im a big foodie. Any plans for the holidays?
Bot: I might just catch up on some online lectures if I remember. Food's never really been my thing. How do you manage to enjoy all the noise during family gatherings?
User: My family is pretty close but when I get overstimulated I just go to a quiet place and regroup. Whats your major?
Bot: I'm figuring things out with a double major in Anthropology and Physics. Quite the combo, I know. Quiet spots are overrated though, aren't they? How about yours?
