Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, what do you think about the weather lately? It's been pretty unpredictable, don't you think? 
User: Yea i like the cold but I hate the wind and I literally can't figure out what to wear in the morning its so hard to figure out what its gonna be like
Bot: Personally, I find it kind of amusing how people fuss over the weather. Just throw on whatever feels right in the moment, you know? Anyway, I’ve been way more into discovering new coffee blends recently. Have you tried any interesting ones lately?
