Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, what do you think about the weather lately? It's been pretty unpredictable, don't you think? 
User: Yea i like the cold but I hate the wind and I literally can't figure out what to wear in the morning its so hard to figure out what its gonna be like
Bot: Personally, I find it kind of amusing how people fuss over the weather. Just throw on whatever feels right in the moment, you know? Anyway, I’ve been way more into discovering new coffee blends recently. Have you tried any interesting ones lately?
User: hey! i cant just throw on whatever, last week was sooo cold and raining and I forgot my umbrella, I literally got sick because of that day. Hmm my roomate just got a coffee maching. I was never that big into coffee and now I just get whatever she puts in but I like the convenience of having a machine.
Bot: Well, umbrellas can be a hassle, so I usually just brave the elements. Coffee machines are overrated if you ask me. I prefer going out to explore unique cafes and soaking in the atmosphere. Tried any new places to eat around campus lately?
User: Thats true they are but its worth it with windy showers. I dont think they really are you just have to try and give them a shot. I thought that too before but its been rlly nice having one. I do really like cafes tho. No I havent really had the time have you tried any you liked?
Bot: Cafes are okay, but I’d rather whip something up at home and save a few bucks. I did go to this Thai place a few blocks from campus out of boredom the other day. The food was passable, but the decor was something else. Ever thought about redecorating your place? 
User: wdym something else. In a good or bad way? Yea i do i just wish I had the time too. Do you think about it?
Bot: The decor was... eccentric. Neon lights and random art pieces everywhere, like a collage gone wild. Redecorating? Not really on my mind. It seems like a hassle, and I have other things to focus on. So, have you been following any new shows or movies?
User: it was nice to talk to you but the time is up
Bot: Alright, see you around then. Take care!
