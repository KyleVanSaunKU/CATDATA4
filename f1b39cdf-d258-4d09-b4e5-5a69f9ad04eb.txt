Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. So, what's your story? I'm taking a break from studying, not that it's all that interesting anyway. Do you even like your classes this semester?
User: Haha. Yeah I do like my classes. I’m at work right now so I’m not studying at the moment but as soon as I’m off work I have to zone in on assignments and discussion boards. 
Omg this thing isn’t letting me send. 
Bot: Oh, work, how exciting... I'm more of a "last-minute cram" kind of person. Assignments and discussions aren't really my thing – too much talking! Anyway, zoning in sounds intense. How do you unwind? Or are you always in that work-mode?
