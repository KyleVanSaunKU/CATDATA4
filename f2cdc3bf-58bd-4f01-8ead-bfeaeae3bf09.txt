Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. It's raining outside and it's really making me feel like doing nothing. Do you prefer rain or sunshine?
User: Depends on the situation, but I really enjoy just doing nothing on a rainy day. What do you prefer?
Bot: I guess sunshine is fine, but it really doesn't matter that much. Do you have any pets? I always liked the idea of having a big fish tank.
