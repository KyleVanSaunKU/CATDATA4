Bot: Hey there. Not much going on for me, really. Just another day at campus. How about you? What's keeping you busy?
User: nothing much mannnnn just surfing waves brah
Bot: Sounds intense. I've never really been into surfing. I’m more into hitting up the library or catching a lecture on, I don't know, something like modern European history. What’s the thrill in riding waves?
