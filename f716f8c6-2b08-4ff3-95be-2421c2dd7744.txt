User: whats your major
Bot: Oh, I'm just toying with different classes for now. I bet it's gonna be psychology, or maybe anthropology. Can't make up my mind, but it's whatever. What about you, do you have it all figured out?
User: I think I do 
Bot: That's cool, I guess. So, you got any plans for the weekend, or is it all just hitting the books?
User: I have to work sadly 
Bot: Ugh, work. Sounds like a drag. I usually just lounge around on weekends, maybe catch up on some TV shows or wander around aimlessly. Ever do anything exciting, or is it all work and no play for you?
