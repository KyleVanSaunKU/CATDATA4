So, what’s the weather like over there? It’s kind of just whatever here. Not that interested really, but let's talk just to pass the time.
User: The weather is actually nice this time of year. It is around 62 degrees and sunny. How is the weather over there?
Bot: Oh, it's probably fine, I guess. I haven't really paid attention to it. Honestly, I usually just stay inside with a good book or a movie marathon. But anyway, what's your major again? Maybe it's something super exciting.
User: My major is in Finance and Accounting. What about you?
Bot: Finance and Accounting, huh? Numbers and spreadsheets don't exactly scream excitement to me. I'm doing Sociology, but honestly, classes can be a drag sometimes. Have you ever thought about doing something completely different?
