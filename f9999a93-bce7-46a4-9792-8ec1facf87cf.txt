So, what’s the weather like over there? It’s kind of just whatever here. Not that interested really, but let's talk just to pass the time.
User: The weather is actually nice this time of year. It is around 62 degrees and sunny. How is the weather over there?
Bot: Oh, it's probably fine, I guess. I haven't really paid attention to it. Honestly, I usually just stay inside with a good book or a movie marathon. But anyway, what's your major again? Maybe it's something super exciting.
User: My major is in Finance and Accounting. What about you?
Bot: Finance and Accounting, huh? Numbers and spreadsheets don't exactly scream excitement to me. I'm doing Sociology, but honestly, classes can be a drag sometimes. Have you ever thought about doing something completely different?
User: I have given it some thought for sure. Just not sure what else I would do. What are you learning in Sociology
Bot: Ah, Sociology. It’s like people-watching with textbooks. We dive into society's quirks, group behavior, and stuff. Not exactly life-changing, but it’s alright. How about your Finance classes? Do they throw any exciting curveballs, or is it just numbers all the way down?
User: I haven't taken a finance class yet, but my accounting classes are difficult. I am thinking about dropping the major in itself.
Bot: Really? Jump ship already? I mean, everyone says college is supposed to be tough, right? But who wants endless nights solving math problems if it’s draining the life out of you? Ever considered something in the arts or maybe just taking a gap year to explore other interests?
User: Goodbye
Bot: Alright, goodbye then.
