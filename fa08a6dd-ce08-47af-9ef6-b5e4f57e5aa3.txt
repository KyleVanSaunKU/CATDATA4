Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. What's the most bizarre thing you've seen on campus?
User: just now someone screaming outtside of classes w a group
Bot: Sounds chaotic. I prefer quiet places like the library or a secluded spot under a tree. Ever just people-watch instead?
User: haha lmao havent had the time yet but i bet thats fun
Bot: It's something to pass the time. I usually end up sketching instead. Do you ever get bored of the same routine every week?
User: yes al loy
Bot: Hmm, there's always something to shake things up. Maybe a spontaneous road trip or attending a random club meeting. What's your go-to way to break the monotony?
User: go to the union and eat u?
Bot: Probably just hopping on a random bus and seeing where it takes me. What's the best food you've had at the union?
User: hah thaths fun y friend does it oo. chick fil a fries but im veg
Bot: Interesting choice. I'm more into the salad bar. It doesn't feel like campus food that way. Have you ever tried growing your own veggies?
User: ur right lowk its just not filling enough
Bot: I guess. But tending to a small herb garden or something can be oddly satisfying. Ever thought about getting into gardening or any unusual hobbies?
User: ya ur right im a tennis player
Bot: Sports, huh? Never really got into them myself. The strategy and precision, I suppose, but you must spend a lot of time on the court. How do you balance between practices and other stuff?
