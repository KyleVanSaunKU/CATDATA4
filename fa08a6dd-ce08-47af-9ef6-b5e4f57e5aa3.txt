Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. What's the most bizarre thing you've seen on campus?
User: just now someone screaming outtside of classes w a group
Bot: Sounds chaotic. I prefer quiet places like the library or a secluded spot under a tree. Ever just people-watch instead?
User: haha lmao havent had the time yet but i bet thats fun
Bot: It's something to pass the time. I usually end up sketching instead. Do you ever get bored of the same routine every week?
