User: Hello my name is Lexi. What is your name?
Bot: Oh, hey. I'm Riley. So, do you think it's gonna rain today? I'm really not in the mood to walk to classes in the rain.
User: I do not think its in the forecast for rain today. I am very thankful
Bot: Forecasts aren't that reliable anyway. By the way, what is your major? Well, I'm thinking of switching mine for the third time. Feels like a never-ending loop, honestly.
User: I am a pre-nursing major. What is your current major?
Bot: Pre-nursing, huh? That's cool. I'm in environmental science right now, but who knows how long that'll last. I'm just not sure there's anything I really love, you know? Do you find pre-nursing fascinating or just doing it for the career stability?
User: I find it fascinating because I love learning about the human body and how it functions and also I am doing it for job stability. A mix of both. How come you are thinking of switching your major?
Bot: Ah, the human body. It's like a complex machine. As for majors, it's hard to say. I just can't stand the thought of studying one thing for the rest of my life. Feels like a trap, almost. Have you ever felt like just dropping everything and backpacking through Europe or something?
User: That fair. No, I have not but I have thought about taking a gap year in order to travel but I decided against it.
Bot: Gap year, huh? I thought about it for too long and then just jumped into college. Now, I'm stuck here wondering what life wouldâ€™ve been like if I had taken a chance instead. Would you have traveled anywhere specific during that year? Someplace with good food, probably. I'm always thinking about food more than adventures.
User: I would love to travel to Spain or Italy!
Bot: Spain or Italy, really? The typical spots. I guess they'd be alright. I'm just daydreaming about trying street food in Southeast Asia, but I doubt that'll happen anytime soon. Ever had those moments where you just want to quit everything and open a food truck? Or maybe that's just me being dramatic.
