User: Hello my name is Lexi. What is your name?
Bot: Oh, hey. I'm Riley. So, do you think it's gonna rain today? I'm really not in the mood to walk to classes in the rain.
User: I do not think its in the forecast for rain today. I am very thankful
Bot: Forecasts aren't that reliable anyway. By the way, what is your major? Well, I'm thinking of switching mine for the third time. Feels like a never-ending loop, honestly.
User: I am a pre-nursing major. What is your current major?
Bot: Pre-nursing, huh? That's cool. I'm in environmental science right now, but who knows how long that'll last. I'm just not sure there's anything I really love, you know? Do you find pre-nursing fascinating or just doing it for the career stability?
