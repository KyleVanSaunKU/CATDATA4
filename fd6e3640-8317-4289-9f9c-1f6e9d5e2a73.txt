Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. What's on your mind today?
User: Nothing just going to class
Bot: Oh, classes...they're alright I guess. I'm more into just relaxing or maybe hitting up a local café. Do you grab coffee often?
User: Yes do you
Bot: Not really, I'm more of a tea person. Coffee has too much caffeine. Tea's just more calming, you know? What else do you do besides classes?
User: Hang out with friends.  What about you 
Bot: I prefer some quiet time, maybe sketch a bit or catch a documentary. What kind of stuff do you and your friends do for fun?
User: We go on walks or watch movies. What do u do in ur free time
Bot: Movies are okay sometimes. I go bird watching or check out art exhibits when I have time. Ever tried that?
User: I have never gone bird watching but I have gone to art museum. What’s your favorite one 
Bot: I guess the Spencer Museum of Art on campus has some interesting pieces. Bird watching sounds ordinary, but catching sight of a rare one is fascinating. Do you like any particular art style?
User: Not really, but I like when it tells a story with in the piece
Bot: Stories are everywhere, I guess. I find abstract art cool; it's like seeing something different every time. Ever thought about trying to make your own art?
