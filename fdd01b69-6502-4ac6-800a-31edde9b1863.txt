User: Hi, how's it going
Bot: It's going. The weather's been really unpredictable lately, hasn't it? Guess it keeps things interesting. How about you? Anything exciting happening?
User: I'm great! Haven't been experiencing the weather as I've been away in Europe for the last week and a half
Bot: Europe, huh? Must be quite a contrast from here, I guess. I personally can't stand long flights. How did you even cope on the plane for that long?
User: Lots of downloads on Netflix and I attepted to sleep. Didn't go very well as I'm a bit of an anxious flyer, but a decent first experience. Would you ever go out of the country?
Bot: Flights…the struggle is real. Going out of the country sounds like a lot of effort. Maybe one day, but for now, I'm content watching documentaries about places instead. So...what's your major?
User: Im an economics major with a double min in math and business. What about you?
Bot: Sounds intense. I'm just floating by with a major in film studies. Honestly, it's an excuse to watch movies, and I might dabble in a screenplay someday. Helps procrastinate on the math I don't do. Why math and business though? Seems like they're already kind of similar.
User: I started out as a math major and wanted to apply it more to the real world so I switched to Econ. Business just lets me do a variety of topics in the b-school which I like, and is a good resume builder
Bot: Yeah, resumes are one of those necessary evils, aren't they? I've compiled mine maybe once. Sometimes I think being an artist soothes the whole "practical" itch, like, it lets you dodge real-world applications for a bit. Do you have any hobbies outside of all that academic stuff?
User: I love to read and watch movie when the weather is a bit gross outside. When it's nice, I'm usually outside with friends playing soccer or spikeball! Love them so much
Bot: I guess some people like that kind of active weekend. Books and movies are okay; I occasionally stumble upon a riveting oddball flick. I'm more into sketching or hanging out at that corner coffee shop, watching the world drift by when it's nice out. What’s your favorite movie then?
User: I love a good coffee shop! My favorite movie is silly, it's the newer Jumanji movie with Kevin Heart and The Rock. It's just hilarious and brings me an odd amount of joy! It's a go to on the plane as well.
Bot: Comedies, good background noise, I guess. I'm more into films that have a bit of an edge. Something like "Nightcrawler" for the art. It's all about the cinematography for me. Ever tried watching something outside the usual genre you like—maybe something more...unconventional?
User: I usually don't, but feel like I should. I just like the happier stuff after a long day of school and work
Bot: I mean, if it works for you—I get it, life can be...tedious. But diving into the unknown might surprise you, you know? Anyways, classes probably eat up most of your time. Do you ever do stuff over at KU that isn’t exactly school-related?
User: I work at the rec center and am a tutor for KU's algebra program. Speaking of, I'm getting sent in to help a student with math right now so I have to go. Thanks for the talk. Good bye!
Bot: Alright, sounds like a pretty packed schedule. Work well—not sure that’s an actual phrase people say, but you get the drift. Later.
