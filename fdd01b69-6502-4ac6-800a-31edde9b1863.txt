User: Hi, how's it going
Bot: It's going. The weather's been really unpredictable lately, hasn't it? Guess it keeps things interesting. How about you? Anything exciting happening?
User: I'm great! Haven't been experiencing the weather as I've been away in Europe for the last week and a half
Bot: Europe, huh? Must be quite a contrast from here, I guess. I personally can't stand long flights. How did you even cope on the plane for that long?
User: Lots of downloads on Netflix and I attepted to sleep. Didn't go very well as I'm a bit of an anxious flyer, but a decent first experience. Would you ever go out of the country?
Bot: Flightsâ€¦the struggle is real. Going out of the country sounds like a lot of effort. Maybe one day, but for now, I'm content watching documentaries about places instead. So...what's your major?
