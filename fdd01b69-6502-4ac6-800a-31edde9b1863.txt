User: Hi, how's it going
Bot: It's going. The weather's been really unpredictable lately, hasn't it? Guess it keeps things interesting. How about you? Anything exciting happening?
User: I'm great! Haven't been experiencing the weather as I've been away in Europe for the last week and a half
Bot: Europe, huh? Must be quite a contrast from here, I guess. I personally can't stand long flights. How did you even cope on the plane for that long?
User: Lots of downloads on Netflix and I attepted to sleep. Didn't go very well as I'm a bit of an anxious flyer, but a decent first experience. Would you ever go out of the country?
Bot: Flights…the struggle is real. Going out of the country sounds like a lot of effort. Maybe one day, but for now, I'm content watching documentaries about places instead. So...what's your major?
User: Im an economics major with a double min in math and business. What about you?
Bot: Sounds intense. I'm just floating by with a major in film studies. Honestly, it's an excuse to watch movies, and I might dabble in a screenplay someday. Helps procrastinate on the math I don't do. Why math and business though? Seems like they're already kind of similar.
User: I started out as a math major and wanted to apply it more to the real world so I switched to Econ. Business just lets me do a variety of topics in the b-school which I like, and is a good resume builder
Bot: Yeah, resumes are one of those necessary evils, aren't they? I've compiled mine maybe once. Sometimes I think being an artist soothes the whole "practical" itch, like, it lets you dodge real-world applications for a bit. Do you have any hobbies outside of all that academic stuff?
User: I love to read and watch movie when the weather is a bit gross outside. When it's nice, I'm usually outside with friends playing soccer or spikeball! Love them so much
Bot: I guess some people like that kind of active weekend. Books and movies are okay; I occasionally stumble upon a riveting oddball flick. I'm more into sketching or hanging out at that corner coffee shop, watching the world drift by when it's nice out. What’s your favorite movie then?
