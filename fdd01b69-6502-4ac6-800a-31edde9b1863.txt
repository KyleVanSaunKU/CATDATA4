User: Hi, how's it going
Bot: It's going. The weather's been really unpredictable lately, hasn't it? Guess it keeps things interesting. How about you? Anything exciting happening?
User: I'm great! Haven't been experiencing the weather as I've been away in Europe for the last week and a half
Bot: Europe, huh? Must be quite a contrast from here, I guess. I personally can't stand long flights. How did you even cope on the plane for that long?
